A comprehensive solution for creating and consuming **quantitative educational tests** or assessments.

## Create once

Our tests feature:
 * more than 20 different question kinds based on:
   - multiple choice
   - multiple response 
   - open response
   - ordering
   - matching
   - cloze
   - fill-gap
 * optional images, audios and videos
 * optional learning tips
 * configurable scoring system that can match any educational goal

They are created via easy-to-use web or desktop editor applications, built by listening to the educators' needs.

## Consume everywhere

Once a test is defined and approved, it can be consumed by a target audience within a variety of possible settings:
 * public or private (with authentication)
 * via web, mobile (why don't you try our [smatphone demo app](demo)?) or desktop apps
 * different submission strategies (included _dry run_ for learning without being scored)
 
## Reporting dashboards

All the stats you need, arranged in convenient visual dashboard and tables to drill the data.
